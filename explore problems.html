            <h3>What Is Harassment?</h3>
            <p>While harassment might seem like an obvious thing when it happens, it's reported that 34% of employees truly do not grasp the concept of harassment or behaviors that lead to a hostile working environment.

                Harassment is any unwanted behavior, physical or verbal (or even suggested), that makes a reasonable person feel uncomfortable, humiliated, or mentally distressed.
                
                Depending on state laws, the definition and boundaries for what's considered harassing behavior may slightly vary.
                
                During a harassment suit, a lot of things come into consideration. While harassment laws differ between states, most states consider these two main factors when deciding the validity of an accusation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Simple Function to create a column named "status"</li>
                <li>The perpetrator's intention (or un-intention) to annoy, threaten, or demean the victim.</li>
                <li>Repetition and severity of the unwanted action.</li>
                
            </ul>

            <h3>Domestic Violence</h3>
            <p>Domestic violence occurs in a domestic or cohabitation setting, although the abuse itself doesn’t have to happen in a private setting. Abuse can happen between spouses, partners, family members, or even housemates. In some countries, domestic abuse is even part of a tradition, such as child marriage or corporal punishment.</p>
            <p>Domestic abuse is hard to detect and report, especially since the victim spends so much time around the abuser and can be reluctant to file a report. Abuse that hasn’t reached a physical level is even harder to detect since there are various manipulation techniques that the perpetrators can use to make it seem like what they’re doing is natural.</p>

            <h3>Elder or Dependent Adult Abuse</h3>
            <p>Elder abuse is mostly done by caregivers, such as family or employees at a nursing home. However, elder abuse can also be done by someone close to the elderly, such as fellow residents at a nursing home, neighbors, or family and friends.</p>

            <h3>Sexual Harassment</h3>
            <p>Sexual harassment can mean harassment caused by a person’s sex that makes the harassed feel uncomfortable, unsafe, or humiliated. It can also be considered as any unwanted sexual advances, such as inappropriate comments that are sexual in nature, requests for sexual favors, unwarranted physical touch, or even sexual assault.</p>

            <h3>Civil Harassment</h3>
            <p>Civil harassment is often classified as acts of abuse by someone you don’t have a close relationship with. Abuse by a family member that doesn't fall under the domestic violence case is also considered a civil harassment case.</p>

            <h3>Criminal Harassment</h3>
            <p>Criminal harassment suits are linked to harassment against protective groups that are designed to annoy, harm, or terrorize. The protected groups include people of a certain gender, sexual orientation, race, national origin, religion, age group, or disability.</p>

            <h3>Cyberbullying or Cyberstalking</h3>
            <p>Cyber harassment, or online harassment, refers to acts that are designed to harm, stalk, or terrorize someone through any form of electronic communications, such as social media, text messages, or phone calls.

                It’s easier to harass people virtually since it will be hard to track the parties involved. Cyber harassment can include harmful comments, derogatory websites, and untruthful posts, as well as hateful or offensive emails intentionally designed to terrorize a person.
                
                While cyberbullying seems light compared to other forms of harassment, especially since there are no bodily injuries caused, cyberbullying causes significant damage to a person’s mental state. It can also escalate into a physical confrontation.</p>
            <p>Cyberbullying can be extremely difficult to detect or identify as there are sometimes privacy laws, restrictions, and rights owners have. This is why it is especially critical to train your entire workforce to avoid and handle all acts of cyberbullying or malicious online activity.</p>
